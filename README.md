Lecture: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11G4jnAL88mJGUB1rnjOupDGj3wRoSCSAV8kriX_J3RY/edit?usp=sharing
Report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hiMhx4a7hAWtOkaTgXeq9mJtb7TsjOXE6ypZMtc4J4I/edit

Code Portion:

Your code should be turned in via GitHub. It should:

conform to the template structure discussed in lecture,
contain a rudimentary data ingestion pipeline,
include documentation both in your README.md, describing the purpose of the code, its contents, and how to run it.
be runnable runnable via the command python run.py data. Include a data-params.json file in the config directory, which specifies any data-input locations. If your data-ingestion requires data that is on your local computer, include a copy of the data in your domain’s /teams directory on the DSMLP server and include that location in your data-params.json.

For both the Report and Code Portion, write in a Canvas comment listing what tasks each group member was responsible for.
